# BWTC32768
A highly-efficient, fully-handwriteable, legacy-compatible, human-readable, human-speakable, unambiguous, mostly safe, text-armored, and simple UTF16-based binary-to-text file encoder based off tinygma's CJK-only implementation of github user @qntm's Base32768 (by user @kusano_k on https://qiita.com/kusano_k/items/124727ed346a008434c9 (who also goes by @kusano on Github), who put the full implementation on https://tinygma.sweetduet.info), that compresses the input data with github user Elad Karako/@eladkarako's compressjs-flattened's bwtc algorithm (originally written in GNU C by github user @pjkmikkol/Pekka Mikkola (with code and concepts from Julian Seward, Yuta Mori, Peter Fenwick, Juha Karkkainen, Dominik Kempa, and "Elias, Rissanen and Pasco, plus Alistair Moffat, Radford Neal and Ian Witten", Michael Burrows, and David Wheeler) and ported to JS by github user @cscott/C. Scott Ananian as a part of compressjs) that beats bzip and bzip2 by Julian Seward (with the BWT from Michael Burrows and David Wheeler, David Huffman for the Huffman coder, Peter Fenwick for the Arithmetic coder, and "Elias, Rissanen and Pasco, plus Alistair Moffat, Radford Neal and Ian Witten" for the original Arithmetic Coder that Peter Fenwick improved.) on "https://bzip.org". There are probably many others left to credit. Credit goes to them.
