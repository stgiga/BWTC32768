# bwtc32768
A highly efficient, fully handwriteable, legacy-compatible, human-readable, speakable, unambiguous, mostly safe, and simple UTF16 binary-to-text file encoder based off tinygma's CJK-only implementation of qntm's Base32768 (by sweetduet), that compresses the input data with eladkarako's compressjs-flattened's bwtc algorithm (originally written in GNU C by pjkmikkol) that beats bzip and bzip2.
