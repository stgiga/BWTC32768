# bwtc32768
A highly-efficient, fully-handwriteable, legacy-compatible, human-readable, human-speakable, unambiguous, mostly safe, text-armored, and simple UTF16-based binary-to-text file encoder based off tinygma's CJK-only implementation of github user @qntm's Base32768 (by user @kusano_k on https://qiita.com/kusano_k/items/124727ed346a008434c9, who put the full implementation on https://tinygma.sweetduet.info), that compresses the input data with github user @eladkarako's compressjs-flattened's bwtc algorithm (originally written in GNU C by github user @pjkmikkol and ported to JS by github user @cscott as a part of compressjs) that beats bzip and bzip2 by Julian Seward on "https://bzip.org".
